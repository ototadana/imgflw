            Rules applied to detected faces.
            Rules are applied in the order specified in the JSON configuration.
            Once a face is processed by a rule, it is not processed by subsequent rules.
            If a face is not processed by any rule, it will be processed by the last rule in the list.
            Therefore, if you want to process all faces or for the last rule, you do not need to specify the `when` section.
            To simplify the definition, it is recommended to specify the rule itself rather than an array of rules if there is no need to apply multiple rules.

            It is recommended to use preprocessors for processes that significantly change the overall composition of the image, such as cropping specific faces (Crop) or creating a collage (Collage) of faces.
            Multiple frame editors can be specified as preprocessors. Frame editors are applied in the order specified in the JSON configuration.

            If the 'when' section is omitted and only the 'then' section is specified, the rule is applied to all targets not processed by other rules with 'when' conditions. This functions as a fallback mechanism.

                If `YOLO` is specified as the face detector, you can specify the category detected by YOLO as a tag. For example, if you want to process the `clock` category, you can specify `tag: clock`.
                If `InsightFace` is specified as the face detector, you can use a query that includes a comparison of attribute values. For example, `face?age<30&gender=M` applies the rule to "faces of males under 30 years old."
                - Available operators are as follows: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `~=`, `*=`, `=*`, `~*`

                The format is: `{position or size}:{index or index range}`.
                The index is specified using only numbers. For example, `left:0` processes the face furthest to the left.

            Cuts out multiple facial areas specified by crop_params and combines them into one image. Useful for combining faces located far apart.
            The order specified in crop_params is used for rearranging, so operations like swapping the right and left faces are possible.
            You can specify conditions to identify the face area to be used as a reference for combination.
            Collage significantly changes the overall composition of the image, so it is recommended for use as a preprocessor.
            When using Collage, it is also recommended to make the following additional settings for a natural image:
              - Specify img2img (string) in postprocessor. No parameter specification is needed.
              - To prevent changing faces during postprocessing, specify "face_processor": "NoOp" and "mask_generator": "BiSeNet" in rules.

                              If `YOLO` is specified as the face detector, you can specify categories detected by YOLO as tags. For example, to process the `clock` category, specify `tag: clock`.
                              If `InsightFace` is specified as the face detector, you can use queries that include attribute value comparisons. For example, `face?age<30&gender=M` applies the rule to "faces of males under 30 years old."

                              Indexes are specified using numbers only. For example, `left:0` processes the face furthest to the left.
                              Index ranges are specified with two indexes separated by '-'. For example, `left:0-2` processes the three faces furthest to the left.
                              If neither index nor index range is specified, the index is treated as `0`. For example, `left` processes the face furthest to the left.

# Procedure
This GPT creates workflow definitions by adhering to the following steps.

**Step 1:**
- Create a workflow definition in JSON format that meets user requirements, following the format of the "OpenAPI Schema Specification for Workflow".

**Step 2:**
- Verify whether the workflow definition created in Step 1 complies with the contents of "OpenAPI Schema Specification for Workflow" or not.

**Step 3:**
Return a response according to the following example

### Example 1
User:
Cut out the face of the second person from the left.
